# opencampus-gan-2022


In its first parts, this work strongly relies on the [GAN-examples supplied by the Tensorflow community](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan) and the work done by Ali Farooq, Felix Flacklam and the author during opencampus' 2020-course "Machine Learning with Tensorflow" named [Resamling Covid-19](https://github.com/vanhog/Tensorflow-Team-2-GAN). The data uses for this project can be found there, too.  

The second part on using a Wasserstein-GAN with Gradient Penalty relies on Courseras GAN specialization and the work of team "testbild" during the opencampus-2021-course "Generative Adverserial Networks" on [heavy metall album covers](https://github.com/Testbild/GANMetalCover).
