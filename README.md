# opencampus-gan-2022


In its first parts, this work strongly relies on the GAN-examples supplied by Tensorflow and the work done by the author et al. during opencampus' 2020-course "Machine Learning with Tensorflow". 

The second part on using a Wasserstein-GAN with Gradient Penalty relies on Courseras GAN specialization and the work of () during the opencampus-2021-course "Generative Adverserial Networks" on covers of heavy metall covers.
